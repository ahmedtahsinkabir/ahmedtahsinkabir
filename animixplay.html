        etc) to other places like myanimelist.net . Here is how :
      </p>

      <ol id="white">
        <li>
          Download your animixplay data
          <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="blue">here</a> (XML).
        </li>

        <li>
          Create new
          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/register.php" id="blue"
            >MyAnimeList</a

        You can then move your data from MAL to another place. MAL is a popular
        website, so a lot of services already have integration.<br />
        You could also export to another format (JSON) if you want read the file
        with text viewer.

    <div>
      <h2 id="glow">Why shutdown the site?</h2>

      <p id="white">
        Scraping another website requires constant maintenance, any structure
        changes or protection measures on another site can break our system.
        Every time we make a workaround to fix, it add additional mess. Now the
        scraper already so messy that this problem might need a total rework to
        fix it. We are not motivated to do this. Our service quality is already
        keep getting worse that we feel it would be better if the site just shut
        down and people went somewhere better. Letting the site half-working
        using existing iframe streams is just not acceptable.<br /><br />We are
        just scraping other websites anyway. There are a lot of other apps and
        websites that do the same. Besides, you can still just go directly to
        the original sites where we get all of the contents, be it wiki sites
        where info is maintained, legal services where anime is originally
        licensed, or another pirate sites where we get their streams (all sites
        in credits).

      <h2 id="glow">What next?</h2>

      <p id="white">
        Thank you for all the support, but AniMixPlay is no longer exist in any
        form, forever. If you found anything that says otherwise, it's false and
        probably just gives you copycat website that uses our brand to gain
        attention. Please don't use them. Just move on, we won't come back.
